Breadcrumbs: Spring Boot Project with Lombok, MapStruct, and Logger
Overview
Breadcrumbs is a Spring Boot project designed to manage books. It utilizes modern Java technologies including Lombok for reducing boilerplate code, MapStruct for mapping between DTOs and entities, and Logger for logging.

Features
Book Management: Create, read, update, and delete books.
Automatic Mapping: Utilizes MapStruct for automatic mapping between DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and entities.
Reduced Boilerplate: Lombok annotations are used to reduce boilerplate code, making the project cleaner and more maintainable.
Logging: Utilizes Logger for logging information, warnings, and errors.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for building Java applications.
Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, constructors, and more.
MapStruct: Generates mapping code between DTOs and entities, reducing manual mapping efforts.
Logger: Provides logging capabilities for recording application events and errors.
Java Persistence API (JPA): Standardizes the management of relational data in Java applications.
